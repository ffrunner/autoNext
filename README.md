Automatically clicks the 'Next' button when it appears.

autoNext is a browser extension designed to automate the clicking of a "Next" button on websites. This privacy policy outlines what data is and isn't collected from users of this extension.

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing activity. The extension operates locally within the browser and interacts only with the webpage to click the "Next" button when it appears.

Permissions The extension requires the following permissions to function:

Host Permission: Our extension requires access to "<all_urls>" because its primary functionality is to automate the process of clicking "Next" buttons on various websites. This host permission is essential because:

1. Interaction with Web Page Elements: The extension needs to access the content of any active webpage to identify and interact with the "Next" button, which can appear on different websites with various structures.

2. Broad Application: The extension is designed to work across many websites that use multi-step forms or paginated content. Since users may need the functionality on different sites, "<all_urls>" ensures that the extension can automate the navigation wherever applicable.

3. Limited Scope and Privacy: Although the extension requires access to all URLs, it only interacts with web pages to perform its core function of clicking "Next" buttons. It does not collect or share any personal information and only runs in response to user actions.

Changes to This Privacy Policy We may update this privacy policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
